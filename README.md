# webscraping

A Web Scraping project to collect the best prices of pc hardware from a website.

It's important to notice the <page_urls> links are already filtered by the website,
given the best price first, for the applied filter.

After getting the data requested it will print the dada in the console and create or
update (append) a CSV file.
